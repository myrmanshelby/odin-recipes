    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not always a morning person, but I certainly do go hangry if I don't
      eat breakfast. This is an easy, delicious way to have some protein in the
      morning, and with the healthy fats and fiber, it keeps my full until
      lunch.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 serving your favorite chocolate protein powder</li>
      <li>1 cup dairy-free milk</li>
      <li>1 handful frozen spinach</li>
      <li>1 tbs peanut butter</li>
      <li>1/2 frozen banana</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>Add all of the ingredients to a blender.</li>
      <li>
        Blend it up until smooth and creamy! If it's not blending, add more milk
        as needed.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
