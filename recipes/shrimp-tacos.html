    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These shrimp tacos are the easiest 30 minute weeknight meal. I ate shrimp
      tacos for the first time in Cabo last summer, and I knew I needed to add
      them to my recipe rotation! The key is to use the air fryer to get the
      shrimp nice and crispy with little effort.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 lb shrimp</li>
      <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
      <li>4 tbs taco seasoning</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>1 can black beans</li>
      <li>1 tbs avocado oil</li>
      <li>2 tbs greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Place shrimp in the air fryer. Cover with avocado oil and toss with half
        the taco seasoning. Air fry at 360 for 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While shrimp cooks, heat the corn tortillas on a pan over medium-high.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss shredded cabbage with the rest of the taco seasoning and the greek
        yogurt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the shrimp is done, assemble your tacos with black beans, shrimp,
        and cabbage mixture. Top with lots of salsa and your favorite taco
        toppings!
